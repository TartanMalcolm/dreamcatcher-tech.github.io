Traces are Bonded Non-Fungible Tokens.  (In Current industrial parlance: Bridge, Wrapper. Bond.)

In established traditional finance “Bonds” are units of debt issued by companies and securitized as tradable assets. In the DCM the “debt” is the State Change, the “company” that issues it is the User who triggered those State Changes and the securitization is the State Changes a User bundles together as a Trace - a tradable asset.
Therefore a Trace references a collection of State Changes.  Ownership is established through the Governance of the Trace, and royalties owed in a Dispersal Event are recorded within its Attribution.

A State Change can only be included within one Trace at a time.  As such, Traces can be considered Bonded NFTs, which can’t be replaced with other tokenized assets of the same type because each token represents a unique unit of value.
Traces may be destroyed through an act of its Governorship, which releases the State Changes and makes them available to be used in further Trace Minting Events.

Traces are bounded units of exclusive utility. They represent a single unit of proprietorship, issued by an author of the State Changes it includes, for an individual commission. The Trace captures and tokenizes the effort, assets, or reputation and is thereby bonded as a tradeable asset. 

Once minted, a Trace accepts all Dispersal Events that would otherwise have gone to any of the included State Changes, and employs its Attribution to Disperse these further.  It may also hold value in and of itself, outside of Dispersal Events.  E.g. a Trace may change ownership in a trade with another User, in its entirety, through change of Governance.  

The Trace Minting Process locks the list of State Changes that that Trace includes.  I.e. The Trace Governance can’t subsequently add or remove State Changes.  However, the Governance may destroy the Trace, releasing the State Changes to be used in other Traces.  Note that an attempt to destroy a Trace will need to be ratified through the Governance of all Contracts in force for that Trace.

Tokenization through Traces allow:
1. Liquidity – By tokenizing effort, real-world assets, reputation and any impact recorded on-chain, issuers can secure liquidity.
1. Fractional Ownership – Fractional ownership arises from alterations to the Governance of the Trace. This allows any number of Users to be recorded, in any fraction allowed by the GovernanceAlgos in force, for that Trace.  
1. Fractional Royalty Rights - Royalty rights are dictated through the Attribution Table of the Trace.  Therefore they can be cut into any shape through Attribution Algos, and the resulting Disperal can go to any other Coordinator Object.  This gives total freedom in defining how to divide the benefit arisings from Dispersal Events that reach the Trace.
1. Faster, cheaper, and dustless transactions – The DCM Gen 4 blockchain enable fast and low-cost transactions, and this relates to the tokenized assets as well.
1. Transparency – Fully Leveraging Blockchain’s unique attributes, including immutability and transparency.
1. Convenience – blockchain makes process more convenient and accessible

A Trace is the smallest possible tracking of Contribution available.  It is an Object that represents events and therefore can be correlated with the effort behind Contribution.  

The creation of Traces is the Dreamcatcher’s reason for existing.  Traces are what people buy and sell when they want to commission work to be done, or purchase work done by others.  This is the ownership marker [r]of contribution.  

For example, a Contract between two Users may be for the creation of code, with the Acceptance being denoted by a Pull Request[s][t] of that code into the main branch of that Project.  The event of the Pull Request automatically generates a Trace.

A Trace can be assigned to someone else by enacting a trade.  A Trace is most likely a security in many scenarios, if it is sold to others for money.  Traces are where royalties are paid during an Ambient Attribution Dispersal Event.  Traces may be subject to speculation, and so we will require value appraisal tooling or the use of Arbitration in place to dampen some of that.

By simply doing work that is recorded ambiently within the Dreamcatcher, Traces are created in their native indirect form.  Until the event that explicitly creates a Trace, work done can nevertheless be derived from records provided no other Trace was created to already bundle up the contributions being referenced.  

Non native Traces can be created to refer to externally tracked work.  For example a Trace can be created for all of Linus’ commits on the kernel in  1991.  This Trace cannot be finalized until Linus himself joins the DCM, provides Evidence of identity to back the claim, and   accepts the trace.  However, unclaimed Non-Native Traces can still be paid in to by others.

Multiple Traces combined together can still be referred to as a Trace.  

In Blockchain parlance Traces are akin to NFTs but are a blockchain themselves, rather than a part of a larger blockchain.  They are also much smaller than current NFTs permit, being in the micro scale by comparison.

The sale of a Trace triggers an attribution dispersal event for all those Traces that contributed to the construction and sale of the Trace being sold.
