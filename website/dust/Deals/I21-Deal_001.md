## Terms

This document refers to Buyers, Funders and Do-ers as defined in the economic model of the Dreamcatcher, found here: https://dreamcatcher.land. In summary:

1. Work is broken up into Packets,
1. Work and funding are expended against Packets publicly and visibly until completion
1. Whenever someone buys the usage of these Packets, the payment is split pro rata amongst all who contributed.

Under this model, we had proposed that [Company] act as a Funder for Packets related to the Blockchain pieces required for their CRM application by way of regular monthly payments. After our initial arrangement for the month of August, two changes occurred:

1. [@dougbear] struggled to make 80 hours of contribution due to circumstances beyond their control
1. We were able to specify a Packet of work much sooner than we anticipated

The Packet we have identified is [I21 IPORM the IPFS ORM] which will benefit by:

1. Making that part of the codebase less error prone and more stable, as it is currently the primary source of bugs in the system
1. Provide a means of encryption at rest, so enabling us to keep all customer records encrypted on the hard drive of the server and in the storage of the staff browsers

[@dougbear] estimates this Packet to require 120 hours of their time, and so the suggested pricing of this packet is $6,000CAD or approximately $7,500NZD. This pricing includes the time [@dougbear] has contributed during the month of August but will not be billing extra for, and also some incidental time helping [@inverted-capital] with review and advice on other areas of the codebase.

Completed Packets distribute any royalties from buyers payments that consume those Packets by way of the Dreamcatcher Algorithm, and since this is not yet constructed any such payments need to be delayed.

My recommendation is that Redlid pay $6,000CAD (approximately $7,500NZD) to Dreamcatcher Gateway Ltd using Wise.com to be held in escrow until the completion of Packet I21, at which time if the QA function (currently [@TemperBead] and [@inverted-capital]) assess that the Packet is completed to satisfaction and there are no disputes raised, the funds are transferred to [@dougbear] or split between any other developers that contributed. If the Packet is not completed within 3 months of Funding, the funds are returned to [Company]. All parties will need to reach an agreement if the work needs to be cancelled and partial payment for work done in earnest needs to be made.

Please let me know any comments on questions on this proposal,
