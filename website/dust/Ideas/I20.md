# I20 Dreamcatcher Algorithm v0

To launch, we need at least _some_ version of the Dreamcatcher algorithm operating. This first version can (and will be) very crude, but it will still be better than the two prevelant models of attribution for software contributions:

1. Nothing
1. Company Shares

For this reason, the working name is the "Better than a worthless pile of tech stock" version.

It makes the following simplications:

1. We only consider code, sales, and funding contributions
1. Sales is fixed at 10% of the value for the first 2 years
1. Code calculated on unique lines of code executed
1. Funding attribution starts at 50%
1. Dependency attribution is done only as deep as the package owner
1. Linux attribution starts at 0.1%
1. Chrome attribution starts at 0.1%
1. Internet Attribution starts at 0.1%
1. Only positive attribution is considered

The primary purpose is to pave the way for an algorithm that attributes based on much more than these blunt methods.

The module will be further split into other modules, to invite modifications on classes of attribution independent of each other. The initial classes are:

1. Code (Writing software)
2. Valet (Introductions to the network)
3. Sales (Converting either Buyers or Funders)
4. Funding
5. Buying
6. Ideation (Working on specifying a Request or an Idea, or comments and issues on work in motion)
7. Coordination (Project management and other admin tasks)
