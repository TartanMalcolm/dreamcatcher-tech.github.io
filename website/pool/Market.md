### Process

1. Requests and Ideas are generated in the NFA section of the site, and ID'd by numbers without titles, to allow the titles to change often
1. Once they pass QA, Requests and Ideas are copied over from the NFAs folder into their respective Pool folder
1. The item is now listed in Market.md, ranked by QA importance
1. If the item is an Idea, then it must be linked to any Requests that it targets, and be indented
1. Pool participants pool resources against the items
1. Once negotiation concludes, resources are locked
1. Once QA assesses that an Idea is completed, it moves to the completed section
1. If the completion of the idea completes any Requests, these are moved to the completed section too
1. As labour is expended against the NFTs in the pool and the logs are updated, the tally of investment increases
