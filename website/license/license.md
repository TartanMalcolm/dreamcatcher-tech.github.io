## License Overview

This document gives the high level overview of the Dreamcatcher License Stack.  This is not yet a legal document, but rather gives the briefing material to a Legal Professional to generate this stack dependent on location.

The Dreamcatcher is a Packetised Innovation Platform that brings together Do-ers (those who carry out tasks), Funders (those who provide capital for tasks to be done) and Buyers (those who look to use the software produced in return from some consideration. 

There is no preferred or authoritative organisation within the Dreamcatcher - and so there is a need to offer to Members a legal template under which they can do business with each other.

### Dreamcatcher Public License (DPL)

The DPL is the foundation of the License Stack.  The DPL comes into force between any two Members of the system who have each unilaterally signed up to the Core DPL, and by doing so agree to be held to its clauses when dealing on the Dreamcatcher with any other Member who has also signed it. It forms a common, basic standard for interactions.

### Dreamcatcher Contracts (DCC)

Dreamcatcher Contracts detail an agreement between a Funder or Buyer and a Do-er, where the Do-er carries out work on a Packet in exchange for the consideration detailed in the DC Contract.  It also stipulates the Pool under which the work is offered; Pools provide access to QA, Arbitration and Escrow services.

Unlike the Core DPL, DC Contracts are not signed unilaterally in advance but rather are agreed between two parties before signature. 

### Modules

Optionally the DPL can be extended by the use of Licence Modules which are unilaterally signed and are consistent with the DPL. If a Module has been independently and unilaterally signed by two parties, it is available to those two parties should they want to do business. I.e. it forms a menu of pre-signed P2P options that can be selected.  An example of a Module would be an NDA which can be references from a Dreamcatcher Contract and enforced through the Dreamcatcher Public License.

## In Use

The aim of the Dreamcatcher License Stack is to provide the DPL generally, optionally to provide off-the-shelf Modules (e.g. an NDA), and to allow hooks in the legal wording that binds these with a Dreamcatcher Contract to provide a legal agreement.

The Dreamcatcher License Stack is captured and executed in code, but can also be condensed into a printable format that can be read by legal professionals and signed by third parties if necessary.
