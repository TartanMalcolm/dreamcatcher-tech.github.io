![manual NFT hand crank Hotpot Art 3](/nfts/handcrank.png)

## Proposal Scope

Targets the earliest possible stage of [01 Dreamcatcher](../Requests/01%20Dreamcatcher.md)

## Proposed Approach

The heart of the Dreamcatcher system need not wait for a software tool to be constructed, and can in fact be conducted using pure markdown documents. NFTs should be constructed using the formats prescribed in the templates for [Requests](../Requests/00%20Request%20Template.md) and [Ideas](./00%20Idea%20Template.md)

The hard part of the dreamcatcher is not building it, but using it. We must force ourselves to use the crux of the process while we are attempting to build it, to discover how the process should work.

The difficult thinking about the content of a Request or an Idea is still hard work regardless of the tool used to capture it, so we should set about doing this hard work in markdown.

Each Request and Idea will have artwork generated for it.

Contributions should be logged per person, and against which NFT they were working towards.

## Proposed Output

The output should be:

1. some templates that have been well used
1. operational data of the basic system in use
1. a thorough understanding amongst participants of how the system works and why its better than traditional methods

This system should be used in the dispersal of funds manually.
