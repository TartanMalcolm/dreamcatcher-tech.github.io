# I11 Request-Idea

## Target

[R10](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/blob/master/website/nfas/Requests/R10.md) - Request-Idea.

## Dependencies


## Proposed Approach

### R10 Tactical Intent 1

### R10 Tactical Intent 1: Must 1, 2

1. Review whether that process is complete and correct in terms of submitting to the [DC Pool Page](https://dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/pool/).  
1. Run through each step in that process and verify whether [The User Dictionary](https://dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/docs/) holds definitions for each of the terms used in the process.
     1. Where a definition exists, check whether it reflects what is intended by the pool process.  If it doesn't update each as an output to this Idea.
     1. Report the count of these definitions that are used in this pool process as a baseline.
     1. Check whether any additional definitions are required.  The aim is to have this as zero.  If some need to be created, create them as outputs and report the delta from the previous step as the increase in complexity.
1. Done is when the process has been used to enter at least one App Request Idea without generating gaps in the definitions.

### R10 Tactical Intent 1: Must 3, 4, 5, 6

1. To "define a pool" we need:
     1. The Process above, stating how to submit to the pool in terms of passing format QA.  This would be in two templates (Request and Idea) with guidance notes, and how to trigger QA to consider the submission.  
     1. Internal Governance guidelines stating how that pool will assess, beyond formatting, the Requests/Ideas and how it aims to prioritise the use of the pool's resources.  This would not necessarily be a publicly available doc, but could be.
     1. For work in progress, state where to create it so that it appears on the website and what the process is to log pomos against the pool Requests/Ideas.
     1. A statement on what the process is for QA to state that work is complete.
     1. A process for generating NFTs, and logging them against the pomos recorded on the pool site.
1. The above to be written into the [DC Pool Page](https://dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/pool/) or linked doc from that page.

### R10 Tactical Intent 1: Must 7

1. As we don't have a clear idea yet of how much effort, in terms of real money, the Request/Ideas will take and don't have a market to discover what that value should be, propose we use pomos as a virtual currency.  Work can be logged against Requests, Ideas and Outputs, but are not issued without acceptance by internal QA.  This would give us a first stab at measuring effort, which can be broadly equated to cash once we've built up some experience recording them as virtual money.


### R10 Tactical Intent 1: Should 1

1. The single operating version can be stated in the pool guidance, and enforced by the internal QA not considering assets outside of that version.

### R10 Tactical Intent 1: Could 1

1. Don't have a clear answer for this, but the above pomo token suggestion would give us in due course a conversion rate.  


### R10 Tactical Intent 1: Should Not 1, 2

1. Internal QA should not issue pomos to work that is submitted that considers edge cases, or attempts to solve problems arising only from the manual version.

### R10 Tactical Intent 1: Must Not 1

1. Again, Internal QA has the pomos - you don't get it if you involve any documentation outside of the Dreamcatcher Website.



### R10 Tactical Intent 2: Must 1, 2

1. Given that a well written Request is probably going to make the Ideas much more straight forward, the main item here is Must 2.  Propose:
    1. Complete Tactical Intent 1.
    1. Take one of the Apps and get it through that process.
    1. Review that process and make any changes that become obvious. (See Tactical Intent 3)
    1. Resubmit until one App is in the pool.
    1. Submit the Idea for that App, and again iterate. (See Tactical Intent 3)
    1. Once there is an App Request/Idea that's passed QA, generate Requests for all other Apps.
    1. At each iteration, there is to be a review of lessons learned for the self improvement of [R10](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/blob/master/website/nfas/Requests/R10.md) - Request-Idea and [I11](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/blob/master/website/nfas/Ideas/I11.md) - Request-Idea.

That would meet minimum requirements where 'some' Ideas = one.  See below for use of stubs.

### R10 Tactical Intent 2: Could 1

1. As we're likely looking at a two stage QA submission process (is it coherent and in format; is it a good idea worth working on), the extension of the App Request/Ideas is likely to be cyclic.  I.e. production of the Request/Idea to sufficient quality to get through the first stage, then consideration of it's merit.  
1. The extension of the initial App Concept is therefore likely to be on the second stage, although some leakage into the first is inevitable and should be tolerated.  NB, until it's passed both stages, it's not in the pool, so QA is a sense check - the extension and checking needs to be done while it's still outside of the pool.
1. It's worth noting that this is a 'could', and so shouldn't distract from the main Intents.  Therefore propose that we complete Tactical Intent 1, Tactical Intent 2 (minus Could 1), before considering extension.  
1. The contraindication to this is that we'd then be extending Requests/Ideas inside of the pool, as R10 Tactical Intent 2: Must 1, 2 would have been completed, so TBD.

### R10 Tactical Intent 2: Could 2

1. Depending on the QA process signed off by QA following R10 Tactical Intent 1, producing stubs may be outside of this R10/I11. Stubs wouldn't pass QA.  
1. That being said, propose an extension to this could along the following lines [CALL OUT: I've just added this concept of extending beyond the base Request entry.  Think this would be a good addition, as Requests may have missed an opportunity that an Idea wants to pick up...]
    1. Given that we're talking about internal QA in terms of prioritisation and what the pool wants to spend money on, we could reduce that QA to allow for stubs.
    1. To remain disciplined, we should note that and after passing in the App Concepts iterated as we would normally do outside of the pool.
    1. In addition, this raises the point of how to accept a Request/Idea into a pool that shows promise and which the pool wants to see happen.  Should it just be down to a fork or carried on outside of the pool?  Perhaps there's escrow for working up an idea that's 'good enough'.  TBD.


### R10 Tactical Intent 3: Must 1

1. To meet this Intent, the above will need to be developed with the two of us, but with different hats on at different times.  TBD, but think that would naturaly happen.


### R10 Tactical Intent 3: Must 2

1. The self improvement process rounds would be based around [R10](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/blob/master/website/nfas/Requests/R10.md) - Request-Idea and [I11](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/blob/master/website/nfas/Ideas/I11.md) - Request-Idea.
1. The opportunties for improvement are likely to come from the experience in delivering R10 Tactical Intent 2.  
1. Therefore see the entry points for where this should happen, noted in R10 Tactical Intent 2: Must 1, 2 above.
