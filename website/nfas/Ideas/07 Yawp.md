## Proposal Scope

*THIS IS A STUB*
  
This idea references the request at [07 Yawp.md](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/blob/master/website/nfas/Requests/07%20yawp.md)


  
Any limitations to this Idea, ie which Tactical Intents does it aim to address.

## Proposed Approach

A freetext area where the Proposer of the Idea can suggest how the Request (or part of that Request) named above can be completed.

Although freetext initially, in order to get Request:Idea lock (and therefore a Contract) it's likely that this section will have to address each of the Tactical Intents that it's aimed at.

## Proposed Output

This section covers what the Asset to be produced is. Ie what is QA considering when it's being asked to release escrow?
