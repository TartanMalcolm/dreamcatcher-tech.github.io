# I12 DC Pool QA

## Target

[R11](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/blob/master/website/nfas/Requests/R11.md) - DC Pool QA

## Dependencies

## Proposed Approach

1. Start with a semi-stub QA guidance doc that essentially provides links to the Request Process and states that it's a nod from the two of us.
2. Run Requests and Ideas through that short process before submitting to the [Poo](https://dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/pool/)
3. Refine through use.

## Proposed Output

1. A guidance doc, laying out what the DC QA requirements are. Trivially in this case, the DC QA Authority will be writing these.
