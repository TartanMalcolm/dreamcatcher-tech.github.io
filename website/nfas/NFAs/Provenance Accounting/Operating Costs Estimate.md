To track each individual object incurs some infrastructure cost. We need to calculate what this cost is so the feasibility can be calculated. It does not make sense to track items whose value is anything less than 100x this infrastructure cost, as a guess.

This is a cost per chain calculation, and based on an estimated chain size, with a rough guess at software labour cost slice.
