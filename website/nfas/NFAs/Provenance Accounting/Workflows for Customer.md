## Description

A target customer has been identified, and the workflows that they expect their business to follow need to be captured. Once these workflows are captured, along with scale estimates and value estimates, we can provide estimates of build time, and a sequence of building out those workflows.

Once these workflows are described, we aim to map them to the competition businesses, to see where our value add is.

Initial workflows that we will automate can then be determined, as well as assessment of alternatives to Dreamcatcher based software.
