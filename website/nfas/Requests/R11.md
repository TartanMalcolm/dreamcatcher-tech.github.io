# R11 DC Pool QA

## Targets

1. [R01 Dreamcatcher](./R01.md)

## Dependencies

## Strategic Intent

![request and lightbulb manual hand cranked cogs Watercolor](/nfts/requestIdea.png)

We have the first pool that will be available for the Dreamcatcher, the DC Pool.  As part of it's use we need to get into the discipline of passing the other Requests and Ideas we're creating through that.

In order to do that, we should generate an Asset which is the guidance for passing.  It may be lightweight, but we shouldn't be informal.

## Tactical Intent

To do this, we need to:

1. Define what the DC Pool requires in terms of format QA, referencing other assets such as [R10](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/blob/master/website/nfas/Requests/R10.md) - Request-Idea, [I11](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/blob/master/website/nfas/Ideas/I11.md) - Request-Idea and their outputs.
1. Generate an Asset with that QA Guidance in.
1. Run the Requests and Ideas that are entered into the pool through that guidance, recording the state in [the DC Pool Stateboard](https://dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/pool/)
