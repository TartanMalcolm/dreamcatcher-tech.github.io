## Strategic Intent

Produce a 'universal computer' with the following properties:

1. Runs on a distributed network of small devices, such as phones.
1. Does not require any centralised back-end servers.
1. Allows permissionless addition of devices to the network without compromising the network.
1. Provides computation and storage resources by distributing the workloads to be done throughout the distributed network of devices.
1. Provides mesh network connectivity between devices to allow data to flow regardless of the availability of any centralised comms network.
1. Provides that mesh network over as large a number of connection means as possible, including: cellular, ethernet, bluetooth and sneakernet (where the connection is made physically.)
1. Allows for data transfer to be delayed owing to the transfer medium without impacting the veracity of the data transferred. E.g. allowing a USB stick to be used as the transport layer, and connect again to the network after an aribtary period of time.
1. Does not rely on any centralised control or coordination. I.e. no 'master' nodes - all nodes should be peers and should not have a preferential position in the functioning of the overall system.
1. Provides a persistent data store that cannot, reasonably, be deleted or corrupted without compromising multiple nodes.
1. Provides a method for users to interact with the system in a manner that may be anonymous, but nevertheless in which key holders can prove ownership/identification on the network.
1. Provides a computing surface on which others can write and run Apps without centralised permission, but with permission of the user running the Apps.
