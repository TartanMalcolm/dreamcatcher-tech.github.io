# R10 Request-Idea

![request and lightbulb manual hand cranked cogs Watercolor](/nfts/requestIdea.png)

## Targets

1. [R01 Dreamcatcher](./R01.md)

## Dependencies


## Strategic Intent

We have a concept in the Dreamcatcher about how the Request/Idea pairing should work. We also have a number of possible App ideas floating about but not in that format. As there's nothing stopping us testing the DC Request/Idea concept using git and .md, then we should in order to test that idea, refine it, and capture the App ideas in a more coherent way in order to be a guide to us and others to come after.

Moreover, this will allow us to start using the DC to track our own time, and in doing so we expect forward progress to be more focused.

The overall aim is to get the absolute minimum version of the Dreamcatcher operating in manual mode, where the minimum version is a knowledge work producing system that can self improve.

## Tactical Intent

To do this, we need to:

1. Define what a Request and an Idea is
1. Enter the general app ideas into the manual system
1. Use the process itself to improve the process using github issues and git commits to the .md files.

## Detailed Description

### Tactical Intent 1: Define what a Request and an Idea is.

#### Must

1. List the concept count required for the implementation by counting the number of items in the Dictionary that need to be used during the execution of this simple system
1. Define the minimum possible Dreamcatcher features using concept count as a comparison
1. Define a Pool where Requests and Ideas enter a marketplace for funding
1. Define a Quality Assurance actor to control minimum standard of the Pool and declare Requests and Ideas as Completed
1. Produce written material that is presented on the website with every commit
1. Use AI generated NFT artwork for each Request and Idea.
1. Handle staking of virtual money against Requests and Ideas

#### Should
Always have a single operating version agreed upon between participants

#### Could
Manage actual money


#### Should Not

1. Attempt to cover edge cases
1. Solve problems that will only exist for the manual version of the Dreamcatcher



#### Must not

1. Involve any documentation outside of the [Dreamcatcher Website](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/tree/master/website) for docs

### Tactical Intent 2: Enter the general app ideas into the manual system

#### Must

1. Enter some of the Ideas into the Pool
1. Produce at least one Request for each App Idea that enters the Pool

#### Should

#### Could

1. Extend or test the content of those App concepts
1. Leave a substantial number as stub Requests or Ideas

#### Should Not


### Tactical Intent 3: Use the process itself to improve the process using github issues and git commits to the .md files.

#### Must
1. Be actively used by at least two actors.
1. Go through at least 2 rounds of process self improvement
