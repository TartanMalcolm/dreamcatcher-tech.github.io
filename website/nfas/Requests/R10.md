# R10 Request-Idea

![request and lightbulb manual hand cranked cogs Watercolor](/nfts/requestIdea.png)

## Strategic Intent

We have a concept in the Dreamcatcher about how the Request/Idea pairing should work. We also have a number of possible App ideas floating about but not in that format. As there's nothing stopping us testing the DC Request/Idea concept using git and .md, then we should in order to test that idea, refine it, and capture the App ideas in a more coherent way.

Moreover, this will allow us to start using the DC to track our own time, and in doing so we expect forward progress to be more focused.

## Tactical Intent

To do this, we need to:

1. Define what a Request and Idea is, the process, how it's used, what format we think it should be in and what the scope of it is (ie what it's not.)
1. Gather the general app ideas we have and put them into that format.
1. Record issues and notes that arise, and if those lead to proposals put those also into the Request/Idea format.

## Detailed Description

### Tactical Intent 1: Define what a Request and Idea is.

#### Must

1. Be consistent with the [Dreamcatcher Charter](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/blob/master/website/docs/Dreamcatcher%20Charter.md)
1. Test edge cases as far as we can see them. E.g. should the DC impose a universal format, should it be imposed through QA for submission to a pool, what if it's used outwith any pool as a pure volunteer project.
1. Work with at least two actors.

#### Should

1. Result in written material that can be presented on the website as future guidance to us and others.
1. Use the NFT system envisaged.

#### Could

1. Integrate with the full process from start to finish. This is likely to need a draft rough full process in order to show hand off points e.g. to becoming a project.
1. Be tested with more than two actors.

#### Should Not

1. Attempt to get to perfect, or attempt to work in serial. That will slow down the work - we're far more likely to make progress with multiple rapid drafts.

#### Must not

1. Involve any documentation outwith the [DC Website Repo](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/tree/master/website) for docs, and the [DC Stack Repo](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-stack)

### Tactical Intent 2: Gather the general app ideas we have and put them into that format.

#### Must

1. Produce Request/Idea pairs of docs for the App concepts we have.
1. Result in docs that follow our own guidelines and templates.
1. Capture the full extent of these App concepts enough to pass our own internal QA, being "would we pass on this Request/Idea pair to a pool that we administer?"

#### Should

1. Result in written App Request/Idea pairs that can be used as examples on the website.
1. Have NFTs issued at a suitable granularity.

#### Could

1. Extend or test the content of those App concepts, although this is not the primary aim.

#### Should Not

1. Expand on the App concepts we have at the moment - we've enough, we're trying to define and use the process.

### Tactical Intent 3: Record issues and notes that arise, and if those lead to proposals put those also into the Request/Idea format.

#### Must

1. As issues arise, record and discuss those issues over git.
1. Where relevant, generate stub blog posts or Issues to alter other parts of the documentation.
1. Where issues generate further work to be done, cascade those into their own Request/Idea pairs.

#### Should

1. Test edge cases. Although not all edge cases need solutions, potential solutions should be identified as not being at odds with the generated process.
1. Provide data on time taken on each asset produced, and issue discussed, in a manner that possibly could be retrofitted into ambient attribution.

#### Must not

1. Record issues or notes outside of the [DC Website Repo](https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/tree/master/website).
