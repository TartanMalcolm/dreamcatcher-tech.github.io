For seven decades, the Turing Test epitomized the daunting limitations in our quest to breathe intelligence into machines. In the last year, it has finally fallen, beckoning a profound reevaluation of our established notions surrounding computational creation and consumption.

The last decade witnessed a remarkable surge in application consumption and capabilities, yet, a parallel evolution in software construction capabilities remained elusive. Our endeavor, through the inception of our blockchain application framework, was to bridge this chasm by enhancing software construction efficiency whilst also extending app functionalities to be decentralized and self sovereign. Despite our robust framework, the journey to its widespread adoption stumbled upon the reluctance of developers to step out of their comfort zones and embrace this new paradigm.

Mel Brooks' seminal doctrine on software construction efficiency argues:

> **There is no single development, in either technology or in management technique, that by itself promises even one order-of-magnitude improvement in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity**
>
> *Fred Brooks - No Silver Bullet - 1986*

We challenge this notion post Turing's fall.

We are shifting from a static to a dynamic Application delivery model. Here, AI meticulously assembles applications in real-time, tailored to the user's instantaneous needs. This transition not only alters the business model but unveils a previoiusly unrealized symbiance between our blockchain framework and AI. Our framework, initially aimed at reducing the cognitive load for human coders, found an unexpected ally in AI, given its aptitude for micro cognitive tasks. By complete accident, the function calling model of our framework is exactly what OpenAI has offered for allowing its latest models to call external functions.

This evolution dissolves the age-old barrier of translating natural language into code, ushering an era where users morph into programmers, seamlessly interacting with the system sans the traditional software industry's mediation.  If a program is delivered as natural language, and it is coded in natural language, then the collapse of the traditional software industry seems imminent by way of a rapid reallocation of resources.

## Changes to the application delivery model
To circumvent large portions of the software industry in the delivery of software value, our delivery model needs to change to Just-In-Time (JIT) AI assembled applications, which differ in the following ways:

**Monolithic to Modular** Transitioning to JIT applications as the sole delivery model empowers power users to tailor systems to their needs, fostering a culture of continuous enhancement. This transformation coalesces into a singular application, the Dreamcatcher, as the nexus for user interaction, facilitated through AI natural language assistant, nicknamed HAL.

**Real-Time Lifecycle** The expedited lifecycle, transitioning from months or weeks to mere seconds, not only accelerates delivery but circumvents the traditional software industry frameworks, rendering them redundant.

**Unification of Delivery** The Dreamcatcher, acting as the sole delivery conduit, simplifies user interaction by adhering to a uniform delivery mechanism. This overhaul obliterates the need for a conventional app store, as the AI scours for necessary components on-the-fly.  A single billing arrangement can be made, with single sign on, offering self sovereign data controls for all AI interactions.

**JIT Applications (Jitters)** Termed as 'Jitters', these applications comprise three windows: chat input, chat history, and a stateboard. The dynamic AI controlled rendering of the stateboard ensures optimal data presentation, adapting in real-time to user interactions.

An example of this interface can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEM5qz__HOU)

**Network Dependency** The deep coupling of the application to the network means communication is now an essential part of computation.  Whilst the blockchain underneath will permit offline usage, the efficacy of the Dreamcatcher is amplified when intertwined with the network, and in particular when interacting with the other human members of the network to solve problems that the AIs can not solve yet.

**User-Centric Development** The model encourages users to morph into programmers, courtesy of the erasure of the boundary between natural language and executable code. This user-centric paradigm, coupled with real-time AI assembly, transcends traditional app development models, promising a tailored, responsive, and intuitive user experience.



## Contrast to the software industry
These two pictures sum up the innefficiency of the current way of doing software, versus the new way we are proposing

### The Old Way (months long)
![](assets/2023-11-04-software-development-lifecycle.png)
This process would typically take months to cycle through and adapt to whatever changes had occured or been discovered since initiation, and cost is typically above $50,000 USD each cycle.  Annoyingly, the output is usually wrong in some way, and almost never caters to a single specific user request.

### Just In Time (seconds long)
![](assets/2023-11-04-agile-loop.png)
In the Dreamcatcher, this whole cycle is managed by AI in very small chunks, at the instant the user wants something.  Things that cannot be done yet trigger external innovation that operates in an elastic fashion, rather than a fixed size team.  Cycle time is measured in seconds, and cost is typically $0.005 USD each time.


## The Innovation Network

The Innovation Network within our framework is a decentralized crucible where problems are identified and resolved in a collective endeavor. Its mechanics are:

1. **Intrinsic Problem Identification and Resolution**:
   The identification and resolution of issues are not extraneous but are embedded within the application itself and handled largely by AI. This integration catalyzes a seamless and continuous feedback loop, akin to how every developer wishes their users would fill in good quality problem reports.

2. **Stucks as Units of Innovation**:
   Represented as blockchain objects, ‘Stucks’ embody the problems within the system. They are the nuclei of innovation, encapsulating the issues awaiting resolution, and remaining as attribution targets upon being resolved. Their blockchain nature not only ensures transparency but enables independent funding and resolution, with trust in blockchain acting as escrow removing the administrative overhead of manual escrow.

3. **Integration within Jitter Applications**:
   The feedback loop encapsulated by Stucks is interwoven within the Jitter applications. This integration not only expedites problem identification and resolution but nurtures a culture of continuous improvement.  Solutions can be incorporated into the application the instant they are available, and the AI agents coordinate to validate improvements in the background.

4. **Innovation as a Collective Endeavor**:
   The decentralized and integrated nature of the Innovation Network fosters a collective endeavor towards problem-solving. It makes users a collaborative part of continuous improvement, with an openness that outperforms closed innovation every time.

## Revenue and Pricing Just In Time
The economic heart of this system is an AI powered, dynamic, ethical and fair machine that incentivizes all contribution that led to the creation of value.  The transparency of blockchain enables trust, and the data processing power of AI allows it to consider all forms of contribution, a dataset too large for any human to parse cost effectively, and too politically charged for any human to rule on without bias.

### Revenue Streams:

The AI powered pricing model determines how much of the revenue goes to which resolved Stucks in a transparent and traceable way, making the possession of resolved Stucks an asset that can be traded based on its future value.  The three routes of money into the Dreamcatcher are:

1. **Computational Usage**:
   The Dreamcatcher is an AI heavy application and requires fees to be able to run.  We will start by marking up this charge, and attributing by way of the pricing model to all the contributors that enabled the operation.

2. **Transaction fees on the Innovation Network**:
    When Stucks are unable to be solved by AI, the humans need to contribute.  They need incentivization by way of payments, and when a Stuck is resolved and these funds dispersed to all who contributed, a portion will be due to the Dreamcatcher.  These fees are expected to be around the 5% mark, depending on what the pricing model computes as a fair cut.

3. **JIT Application Value Creation**:
   With HAL as a personal assistant, entities operating within the Dreamcatcher have deals brokered by AI, employing the pricing model to ensure fair pricing and fair attribution to all those who contributed in making the transaction possible, all in real-time. This peer-to-peer trading activity fosters a seamless trading environment and accentuates the community-driven ethos of the ecosystem by to its transparent nature.
   
   

### Pricing Model:

By intertwining AI and blockchain with a dynamic pricing model and organic revenue streams, the ecosystem can enable permissionless work, where no negotiation for revenue sharing is required or even possible, and you can be given a reasonable calculated return on your contribution before you start working.  The pricing models key attributes are:

1. **Dual-Mode Operation**:
   The fulcrum of this economic model is an AI-driven pricing model operating in a dual-mode. On the buy side, prices the cost of the end product to the consumer, and on the sell side, it apportions the value paid to each contributor based on their input.

2. **Dynamic Pricing**:
   The dynamism inherent in Jitters is mirrored in the pricing model. Its flexibility is crucial for fostering a fair environment conducive to maximal growth and economic throughput.  The rewards you receive for a contribution change as more is learned about the true value that has been delivered.

3. **Ethical and Fair Pricing**:
   The AI model is calibrated to ensure ethical and fair pricing, functioning as a transparent and sensitive arbiter in determining cost and attribution. This ethical pricing paradigm is essential maximal economic growth.

## Conclusion
The Dreamcatcher, with its JIT applications, dynamic pricing, and Innovation Network dissolves the boundaries between users and developers, morphing every interaction into an opportunity for customization and improvement. 

The dynamic pricing model, underpinned by AI, enables optimal growth by offering fairness and transparency, ensuring every contributor in the value chain is ethically remunerated.


In conclusion, this system transforms every user into a potential developer, with AI and blockchain technology enabling real-time customization and innovation, while ensuring fair and ethical remuneration for all contributions.  In this system, applications are living, evolving entities, and problems therein are merely the precursors to innovation.
