Example project funding of Interblock\\n1. Example project funding of DOS\\n\\nSoftware companies make up trillions of dollars on the stockmarket, but the best\\nquality software is actually free - how can we connect these two extremes to\\nsomething more sustainable, and how can we get more software, of a higher\\nquality, faster, and cost lest money ?\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThe utopian model of knowledge work is that all individuals permissionlessly contribute to whatever they are able, in whatever form they can, and can build on all prior contributions from anyone else, while receiving fair recompense based on the value they provided whenever their work is used and reused, all with zero overhead. This utopia is focused on providing pure utility to consumers, and enabling pure contribution from producers. This environment would be ideal Ambient Attribution.\\n\\nTo implement such perfection in our current reality needs compromise and ingenuity. A pragmatic form of Ambient Attribution as presented here has mechanisms to handle corruption, fairness discovery, attack mitigation (eg: lawsuits and corporation pressures), dishonesty, disputes, transaction costs, and management overheads, all while avoiding the perils of central system control. Whilst the perfected version may be some decades away technologically, we see within the rise of blockchains, the basic components required to implement a first iteration. This is what we set out to embody within the Dreamcatcher.\\n\\nBased on two forces:\\n\\n1. fair credit due everywhere\\n1. zero friction for reuse\\n\\n![Iron Triangle of Time vs Cost vs Quality](./2020-12-20-assets/good-fast-cheap.jpg)\\n\\nThese qualities change the bigger the pool gets [graphic of pool size vs ideal\\nmatch] Biggest pool is the lowest friction quality largely depends on the people\\nyou have available. let us assume their is an optimal piece of work, at an\\noptimal price. the more people can do the work the better. less friction, zero\\nfriction company. zero liability, zero friction, never credit. credit being\\ngiven by the worker, acting as a bank.

Depend on each situation. Depends on the utility gained.\\n\\n## Example: Funding Interblock\\n\\nWhat is the prize ?\\n\\n### What is the product ?\\n\\nEquity stake in the upside.

Investors must prove they know what the project is about\\n1. Investors must be able to afford to lose their investment\\n1. Projects must have an earnest goal\\n\\nWe are unable to register many of our projects with the SEC due to our\\nrequirements to stay anonymous. However we support the spirit of the SEC\\nregulations, and we aim to exceed their intention.\\n\\nTo invest in a software project, you must have made a code commit of more than x\\nweighted value, which signals that you know what the project is about, and you\\nhave contributed enough to be part of the enterprise - a worker, as it were -\\nrelying on the efforts of others and yourself to show return.\\n\\nWork cannot be faked, copied, or otherwise, and it makes no difference to its\\nutility if it was done by a machine, a person, or a small dog. It doesn\'t matter\\nif it was done in a virtual machine, bare metal, at gunpoint, or of freewill -\\nit is like gold - it can be tested for purity, and not counterfeited, unlike\\nfiat, and unlike promises, which is what fiat is."}]}')}}]);
