aims to bring together talent and resources in a manner that
avoids waste and benefits all.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> The Dreamcatcher therefore optimizes for:</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Effective use of Talent which aims to incentivize those with specific skills
backed by reputation to work on projects in a permissionless manner, where they
are certain of receiving attribution for their work.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Effective deployment of capital which requires transparency and the accurate
assessment and sharing of risk.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Reuse of prior art which requires the permissionless right to use that prior
art, and the fair attribution of the benefits to the originator.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Sharing of data which requires transparency and deduplication, and
attribution to the owner of that data.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> The Discovery of Demand which aims to allow future need to be matched with
the means to realize it.</p><p>#<!-- -->#<!-- --> The Qualities Required</p><p>We believe the necessity of the following qualities are self-evident:</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> All initiatives shall be Open Source? (Layout suggestion - These might be
grouped)</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Reuse of prior art requires the permissionless right to use that prior art,
and the fair attribution of the benefits to the originator.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Sharing of data requires transparency and deduplication, and attribution to
the owner of that data. (see open source)</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Shorten Innovation Cycle time</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Progress relies on innovation; increased speed of innovation increases
progress. (this sounds very darwinian...do we mean shorter iteration cycle
times?)</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Speed of Innovation is maximized by full use of talent, reuse of prior art
and sharing data. (Short iteration cycle times?)</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Maximize participation</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Full use of talent relies on maximal efficient and effective participation;
this is achieved when all who can usefully contribute, do contribute, and are
incentivized to do so.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Reuse of prior art requires the permissionless right to use that prior art,
and the fair attribution of the benefits to the originator.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Sharing of data requires transparency and deduplication, and attribution to
the owner of that data. (see open source)</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> All three (what are the three? Maybe we should list the (3) core tenets as
1,2, 3 with any additive explanation under them, see above) are maximized by
fairness, when all involved are incentivized in proportion to the returns their
individual contribution has generated, and are safeguarded from the unattributed
exploitation of their work by others.</p><p>#<!-- -->#<!-- --> The Prophecy Statement: A More Perfect Innovation Machine</p><p>From the Constitution comes the prophecy of the Dreamcatcher:</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> There exists a theoretical organization of all resources under the control of
intelligent agents that is maximally innovative.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> It allows no duplication of ideas, or resources, and actively drives towards
deduplication (doesn&#x27;t it allow for versioning, upgrades, etc.? So, I might not
be able to dup an idea but I could version it with full attribution. (e.g., if I
make someone’s code more efficient. Or even make changes to my own code others
are using</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Such an organization has access to almost all human knowledge in real time,
and can represent it as a single hash. (What does this mean? Is this equivalent
to hashing Wikipedia? What does hashing Wikipedia do for humanity?)</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> It has the intrinsic ability to self-improve and therefore will inevitably
tend towards maximal innovation come into existence</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> It can track recognize all contributions at down to an atomic level and can
attributes rewards for useful work fairly to them all</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> The attributions are final and irrevocable. Ownership rights are absolute,
and provable via blockchain. Are we saying that mutability of attribution cannot
be transferred? What if someone wants to sell their attribution? What if an
investment firm would like to buy the attribution rights and bundle them in a
financial product for guaranteed income?</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> It still cannot perfectly know the future, and expresses that uncertainty by
providing a visible and transparent multi-view method which makes alternative
views possible. But it expresses uncertainty as an arbitrary number of
multiverses (duplication with worldview slant. Does this conflict with the no
duplication in section (2)?</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Given this inescapable uncertainty, which reduces over time, it aims to
remove guesswork in attribution by moving the distribution of the benefits of
work until the impact of contribution is certain. It has a perfect memory which
is accessible to all</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Any user can control who they interact with and who has visibility of their
work. It is partitionable, where participants can isolate themselves from others</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Its operation is distributed amongst all participants, each entirely
self-sovereign</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> It is structurally dynamic - rapidly recomposing in response to disaster</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> It is scam-proof. (This is a very bold legal claim that cannot be verified)</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> All agreements freely entered and recorded on the DRM are executed without
fail. (So even bad contract code will compile? Is this a use at your own risk
clause? So, if the contract later is shown to have an error, then its “code is
law” or is there a revert?</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> It recognizes risk given the information available at the point of decision</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> There are no barriers to collaboration beyond access to the DRM. It has the
minimum possible barriers to collaboration between any members</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Every participant can discover every other participant and their works
(searchable?)</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Can improve its own fundamental structure in a manner that is transparent and
predictable - there are no Dictators. (Is this the DAO?)</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Has within its structure the ability to allow the market to self-improve the
algos that are part of that structure. Can improve the algos that runs on that
structure.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> It embodies self-righting stability.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Would replace the patent and copyright system(s) through automation and
transparency. Would begin to replace the patent system as means of protecting IP</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> The Dreamcatcher aims to optimize the speed of Innovation.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> We think the speed of innovation is optimized through fairness and decreased
iteration friction.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Ownership rights are absolute, and provable.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Interaction of individual sovereign rights, with tracking, encourages
collaboration cross-pollination</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Others may have better ideas, so sovereignty is tracked and maintained, and
attribution can be re-assessed as the system improves itself.</p><p>#<!-- -->#<!-- --> Dreamcatcher v1 - The First Innovation Machine</p><p>From the Prophecy Statement comes the first implementation of the Dreamcatcher
Protocol:</p><p>The DCP provides a fair and level playing field for ideas to compete with each
other.</p><p>-<!-- --> Through a socialized capitalism framework, the DCP aims to provide a platform
for commerce that allows the different models available to be tested against
each other in an open marketplace.</p><p>-<!-- --> We provide what we think is a fair algo, asserting that fairness is the most
optimal way to interact, and complete fairness is maximally optimal.</p><p>It is a question for the emergent interaction of free agents on the DCP as to
whether this assertion is true. The DCP provides that platform to test our
assertion that complete fairness is maximally optimal, but is disinterested in
whether that is so; it aims for maximal innovation, however that can be
achieved.</p><p>We further break-down out first guess, that fairness is the most optimal way to
interact, into the following:</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Fair dealing. The greatest speed of innovation comes when the necessities of
all involved are incentivized in proportion to the actual returns their
individual contribution has generated.</p><p>This is in opposition to the current model, where the proceeds of work still to
be done are divided up in advance, on a first come, most attributed basis -
typically, in the form of share structures, share options and bonuses. These
only incentives the first movers or ground floor agents and not necessarily the
most valued contributors. This model increase risk for both capital and labor
since both are competing to become “first movers”. Only a few projects can truly
become “first movers” so the risks are high with little to no ROI. The current
model therefore forces those involved to answer an impossible question - what is
the best way to divide up returns that have yet to be realized, from work that
has yet to be completed, and where it is uncertain who carries out that work or
adds most significantly to the aim of generating revenue? Given that it’s an
impossible question to answer, it leads to significant waste of time and cost in
negotiation, and is hampered by the differing information gradients - where the
information available to two parties negotiating are so far apart as to be
exploitable.</p><p>Compare that to this algorithm: where returns on the various contributions are
calculated after the impact of those contributions are known. This is done by
tracking the various types of contributions, including capital investment,
advice and introductions, code produced. It allows contributors to reduce their
upfront fee in return for a future share of the profits, which shares risk more
evenly between investor and employee. It also does not limit the future
exploitation of the work beyond the initial project,</p><p>real value of all those who contribute, not on a perceived future return which
is inherently unknowable.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Shared risk, shared reward - those contributing source code and effort are
free to choose to work for less, and thereby invest in the codebase they are
creating.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Visibility. The first step to making rational, data-driven decisions is to
capture as much data as possible, making it visible to the decision makers.
Therefore, measure and track everything, to as great a precision, fidelity, and
granularity as possible.</p><p>In order to support Fair Dealing, it’s necessary to have a single,
high-definition record that all involved trusts, and which can be used after the
fact to see whose contributions impacted the returns and by how much.</p><p>This tracking of data has a separate benefit - contributors do what can be
inspected. By signing up to high visibility of your work, generally speaking,
your work improves.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Trust and transparency. Inefficient markets are driven by an asymmetrical
information gradient, information arbitrage where one party can exert an
unearned multiple over another by having greater visibility of information over
another. Therefore, for an efficient market to move towards optimum,
transparency must be increased.</p><p>The ideal market is one where all transactions and data are available for all to
see. This leads to greater trust - no more secrets. (This may be considered
counterfactual since most blockchains Tx are transparent yet malicious actors
still proliferate)</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Sharing of data as an asset. Data compounds exponentially when added to other
data. The maximally useful dataset is the set of all data that exists. Data must
always therefore be shared. (is data sharing free by design?)</p><p>However, the person or organization who generates data has rights over that
data. It is an asset they own, can offer to others, and earn returns from. Data
generated on a person by a third party is still owned by that person. Therefore,
the handling of that data needs to adhere to three concepts: legibility, agency
and negotiability.</p><p>Legibility says you must be able to see and understand what your data is and
what&#x27;s happening to it, including what it&#x27;s being used for.</p><p>Agency says you get to control what data is kept and what happens to it – not
just opt-in and opt-out, but how it&#x27;s collected and stored. You get to modify
it, and what inferences you allow to be drawn. (So, data is inherently mutable
by design?)</p><p>Negotiability says you can see and control the social implications of your data
use, and be able to get value from it.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Permissionless contribution. All who can contribute, and want to contribute,
must be allowed to contribute. That contribution must be supported by Fair
Dealing.</p><p>Talent does not depend on who you know, what your circumstances are, how lucky
you&#x27;ve been at birth. Talent is talent. There is a legion of Leonardos who
haven&#x27;t had a chance to contribute because of chance. Such talent, and talent at
all levels, should be free to contribute at their own risk, and, if that
contribution is useful, benefit from it.</p><p>6<!-- -->.<!-- --> Permissionless investment. All who want to invest can provide a facility to
draw down funds based on their own assessment of the risk, and the returns they
believe are warranted.</p><p>Exclusivity is rarely beneficial, and is warped by information gradients.
Investment should not be exclusive, but should be provided through market
forces.</p><p>Investment is a return for risk taken, and that risk taken is a perception by
both of the investor and labor. Should an investor, through their own fact
checking and diligence, feel content to offer better terms than an investor
(possible confusion) already in place, they should be free to offer that
preferential investment. This activity also provides information about what the
market believes are good ideas, and which are duds.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Payment terms - get paid after the fact - only pay for something if it makes
you money, and only as a fraction of what it made you - side effect is
generating a large dataset of value created in different areas</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Linking of assets to the real world. The greatest utility comes where every
real-world item, including the corporeal and incorporeal, has a mirror in the
Dreamscape. This allows for the greatest fidelity in mapping the real world to
the Dreamscape. The ideal is to mirror everything.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Opensource core. The platform itself is a commons, and must always be held in
common. Paid for transparently, and in relation to returns, available to all to
contribute and invest, available to all to use.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Contributions never die, they&#x27;re built on. Returns from any contribution
never expire, they continue to generate returns to the contributors for as long
as they are useful. Moreover, contributions are always available for others to
build on, and in this way continue to be useful. This building on the work of
others must be recognized and upholded, so that progress is optimized.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Deduplication. The market in ideas is strengthened by deduplicating
(merging?) and combining similar or identical ideas. The most efficient market
in ideas is one where each is unique. Therefore, ideas must be deduplicated
freely, while honouring the contributions of all involved.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> No risk for killing people because of bugs</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Digital court to settle disputes on quality of work</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Eliminate legal anything inside the network</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> All people are equal under these laws - no special cases or exceptions, for
max predictability</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Only induction is manual - all else is software defined - signup to the DPL
should be the last dark ages signature you’ll ever need.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> No power over users - this is a decentralized app, so we cannot kick anyone
off the platform, but we can revoke their legal DPL license if they behave
badly, just as the GPL does.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> No votes from assertion - only votes by activity</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Brand is sacrosanct in the Dreamcatcher - there can be only one brand</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Members can leave and rejoin at any time - you always have control of your
identity chain</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Maximum reach out from network members to non-network members - make it
possible to trade with practically anyone. Probably the only people we would not
make contracts with would be those that expressly prohibit trading with us.</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Requests to alter the DPL or modify its clauses / get our members to sign up
to derivatives need to be made public so we can possibly include something to
cater to them?</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Committing to behave in DPL ways even with people not in the DPL</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Recording of phone calls and all data while performing under the DPL is
encouraged. (One party policy? Or do both parties have to agree in advance?)</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Rules on plagiarism from real of world to in. Inside the DRM closeness and
novelty of ideas is managed by the attribution mechanism</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Rules on closeness of brand and trademark, determined by a machine closeness</p><p>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> No member should be forced to share all their data with anybody, therefore a
